## About The Project

The "101 Google Built In AI" Chrome extension allows users to highlight text on any webpage and receive a summarized version, powered by Google's AI. It provides concise and elaborate summaries, keyword highlighting, and options for saving and collaborating on highlights.

### Key Features

- **Text Summarization:** Condenses highlighted text into concise or elaborate summaries.
- **Keyword Highlighting:** Identifies and highlights key words and sentences within the selected text.
- **Copy/Paste Functionality:** Allows users to easily copy the generated summaries.
- **Highlight Management:** Provides a user interface to toggle between original highlights and summarized text, and eventually delete highlights.
- **Data Storage:** Option to save highlights locally or to a Google Doc.
- **Collaboration:** Planned feature for collaborative highlighting and summarization.

## Architecture

The extension's architecture consists of the following components:

- **Content Script (content.js):** Injects UI elements into webpages, handles text selection, and communicates with the background script.  Uses custom HTML elements (`gemini-dropdown`, `gemini-highlight`, etc.) and CSS for styling.
- **Background Script (background.js):** Listens for messages from the content script, interacts with the AI model to generate summaries and keywords, and sends the results back to the content script.
- **AI Response Module (AIResponse.js):** Contains the logic for interacting with the AI model to generate summaries and extract keywords.
- **Color Conversion Module (colorToFilterCSS.js):**  Calculates CSS filters based on the most common color in the highlighted text.
- **Manifest (manifest.json):**  Specifies the extension's metadata, permissions, and scripts.
- **Server (server.js):** A local server (Node.js with Express) used for markdown to HTML conversion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome or Chromium-based browser
- Node.js and npm (if you want to run the local markdown server)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    ```
2.  **Load the extension in Chrome:**
    *   Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
    *   Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
    *   Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension` directory from the cloned repository.
3.  **(Optional) Start the local markdown server:**
    *   Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`
    *   Install dependencies: `npm install`
    *   Run the server: `npm start`

## Future Enhancements

Based on the `notes.txt` file, the following enhancements are planned:

*   Working copy/paste functionality with visual feedback.
*   A button to delete highlights.
*   Saving copied text to a Google Doc or similar service.
*   Saving highlights locally.
*   Adding collaboration features.
*   Highlighting only the key words in a paragraph.
*   Address the `NotSupportedError` by handling uncommon names or languages.
